## Why FHE Matters

Traditional computation requires access to raw models, creating potential security and privacy risks.  
With FHE:

- All computations occur on ciphertexts  
- Sensitive architectural and site-specific data remain encrypted  
- Users receive actionable insights **without compromising heritage confidentiality**

This ensures that digital twins can be shared and analyzed collaboratively while preserving **cultural and intellectual property protections**.

## Use Cases

1. **Preventive Maintenance Planning**  
   - Run encrypted simulations to identify areas susceptible to erosion or stress  
   - Schedule interventions in advance to avoid irreversible damage

2. **Risk Assessment for Tourism**  
   - Evaluate visitor impact on fragile areas without revealing detailed site layouts  
   - Optimize foot traffic to minimize structural degradation

3. **Environmental Change Studies**  
   - Analyze effects of climate change scenarios on heritage sites  
   - Develop data-driven preservation policies while keeping models private

4. **Collaborative Research**  
   - Multiple institutions contribute encrypted environmental data  
   - Produce combined insights without exposing sensitive individual datasets
